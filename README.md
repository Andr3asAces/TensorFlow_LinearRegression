## Approximating linear regression with Tensorflow... an example using MPG Dataset

Dataset description:

1. mpg: continuous
2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete
3. displacement: continuous
4. horsepower: continuous
5. weight: continuous
6. acceleration: continuous
7. model year: multi-valued discrete
8. origin: multi-valued discrete
9. car name: string (unique for each instance)

At the end of this notebook you will know how to create a neural network that follows the same logic as a linear regression.
